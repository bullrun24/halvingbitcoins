Bitcoin Halving Countdown

This repository contains the code for https://halvingbitcoins.com, a website that displays a countdown to the next Bitcoin halving event. The Bitcoin halving is an important event in the cryptocurrency world that occurs approximately every four years. It is designed to reduce the rate at which new bitcoins are produced and ensure that the supply of bitcoin is limited.

The website displays a live countdown to the next Bitcoin halving event, including the estimated date and time of the event. It also provides information on past halving events, including the date and time of the event, the block height at which it occurred, and the new block reward.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the Moment.js library to calculate and display the countdown timer. The code is open source and available for anyone to use or contribute to.

To use the website, simply visit https://halvingbitcoins.com. The countdown timer will update in real time, so you can always see how much time is left until the next Bitcoin halving event. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
